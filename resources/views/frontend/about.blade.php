                    <h2 class="title-global">Introduction</h2>

                     <p>Living in a first-world country and seeing homelessness, especially during winter seasons, was heart-breaking and six of his friends. They realized it was shameful to witness one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with no basic food or clean drinking water. With an avid intention of 'making a change' in the lives of the underprivileged, they discussed a social action to provide adequate food, clean drinking water, clothing, shelter, and sanitation to support homeless people, orphaned children, refugees, and emergencies in the UK and eventually, all across the globe. However, they came to realize that institutional action leads to sustainable outcomes rather than piecemeal philanthropy.
                     <br/><br/>

                     Each friend personally donates and contributes earnestly, but together, with their passion and enthusiasm for helping and giving back to society, they are confident in elevating their organization collectively and doing something bigger and better with their hearts' content.

                     <br/><br/>
                     Their vision is to inspire positive change by providing clean drinking water, supporting those in need of food, shelter, and medical care, and empowering individuals to live independently through 'start-up' businesses. They aim to create a Community Centre as a hub for education, sports, healthcare, and community hire rooms, generating funds for charitable causes. Their commitment to making a difference is fuelled by the joy they see on the faces of those they help. They strive to bring hope and happiness to individuals and families in need through projects, events, donations, and sponsorships.
